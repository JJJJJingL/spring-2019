## Course Description

Data is everywhere\! Many times, it’s just too big to work with
traditional tools. This is a hands-on, practical workshop style course
about using cloud computing resources to do analysis and manipulation of
datasets that are too large to fit on a single machine and/or analyzed
with traditional tools. The course will focus on Spark, MapReduce, the
Hadoop Ecosystem and other tools.

You will understand how to acquire and/or ingest the data, and then
massage, clean, transform, analyze, and model it within the context of
big data analytics. You will be able to think more programmatically and
logically about your big data needs, tools and issues.

## Credit Hours

This is a 3 credit graduate course. You will spend approximately 3 hours
per week in class. It is expected that you will spend approximately 2-3
hours of outside classroom activities (required readings, homework
problems, completion of labs, quizzes, etc.) for each hour of class
time. You will spend 36 hours in instructional time, and approximately
100 hours in out-of-classroom time.

## Course Objectives

  - Operate big data tools and cloud infrastructure, including Spark
    (with all of Spark’s APIs), MapReduce, Hadoop, Hive, Pig and other
    tools in the big data ecosystem
  - Recognize and use ancillary tools that support big data processing,
    including git and the Linux command line
  - Setup and manage big data infrastructure and tools in the cloud on
    Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services
  - Identify broad spectrum resources and documentation to remain
    current with big data tools and developments
  - Execute a big data analytics exercise from start to finish: ingest,
    wrangle, clean, analyze, store and present
  - Be aware of the responsibilities that are associated with performing
    analysis of large datasets

## Prerequisites

### Essential

  - Experience with R, Python, and SQL for reading files, manipulating
    and analyzing data. **Note:** We will use Python as the primary
    interface to Apache Spark, through
    [PySpark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/pyspark.html)
  - Understand programming concepts (flow control, input/output,
    variable assignment.)
  - Experience with git and GitHub

### Optional and Useful

  - Experience with the command line and terminal shell to navigate the
    file system, manipulate files (create, move, delete, etc.)
  - Experience with remote computing via ssh
  - Understand shell executables

## Credit Cards

You will need a credit card to create an account on Amazon Web Services.
If you do not have a credit card, you may consider getting a pre-paid
VISA card which you can use as the credit card when you create the
account.

# Learning Activities and Evaluation

This is a hands-on, practical, workshop style course that provides
opportunities to use the tools and techniques discussed in class.
Although this is not a programming course per se, there is programming
involved.

## Lectures and In-Class Labs

Every class session will have a lecture portion and many sessions will
have an in-class lab portion. Lab exercises are designed to get you
familiar with the tools discussed in class. In these labs, we will work
through simple examples. The completion of the in-class lab exercises is
part of your attendance/participation portion of the grade.

## Quizzes

You will take online quizzes about the topics/ideas discussed in class
and from the readings. The purpose of the quizzes is to reinforce your
knowledge about the tools and platform and also to help you remember the
nomenclature and terms used in class. The quizzes are open book and you
will take them online through [Canvas](http://canvas.georgetown.edu/).
You can take them at your convenience within the established time
window.

In lieu of a final exam, there will be an in-class, closed book *final*
quiz towards the end of the semester.

## Assignments

You will be given problem sets as homework assignments. The goal of
these problem sets is to use the big data tools to answer some questions
about large datasets. The problem sets will build on the labs and will
be much more elaborate. Deliverables from the problem sets will usually
include code written for your programs and the output produced.

We will be using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) for
problem sets and assignment submissions. When an assignment is created,
we will email you a link that will clone the assignment and create a
private repository for you in your own GitHub account. You will perform
your work within the repository and then push back to GitHub for
submission. If you do not have a [GitHub](http://www.github.com)
account, please create one.

The last assignment can be considered a *mini individual project* and
will be longer, more difficult and comprehensive. This last assignment
will also have a higher weight and will require you to do an end-to-end
analytical pipeling using the big data tools.

## Group Paper Presentation

We have chosen 12 seminal papers in the big data space that will be
presented by students throughout the semester, usually one per week.
Students will be assigned to groups of no more than 5 students, and the
papers will be randomly assigned. The group will read the paper, and
prepare a presentation that will be given at the beginning of the class
session. The presentation must summarize the ideas in the paper and
provide some critical thinking instead of rehashing what is said. All
group members must speak during the presentaiton and you will have a
total of 10 minutes, including Q\&A.

# Grading

  - Assignments: 70% (5 homeworks at 10% each, mini project at 20%)
  - Quizzes: 20% (online quizzes 10%, final quiz 10%)
  - Attendance/Participation: 5% (attendance, in-class discussion,
    completion of in-class labs)
  - Group Paper Presentation: 5%

Final point count is 100. We have no plans to curve the final grade, so
the letter grade will follow standard guidelines:

  - A: 93-100
  - A-: 90-92
  - B+: 87-89
  - B: 83-86
  - B-: 80-82

## Grading Rubric for Homework Assignments

  - We will look at the results files and the scripts. If the result
    files are exactly what is expected, in the proper format, etc., we
    may run your scripts to make sure they produce the output. If
    everything works, you will get full credit for the problem.
  - If the results files are not what is expected, we will look and run
    your code and provide partial credit wherever possible and
    applicable.
  - Points **will** be deducted for each/any the following reasons:
      - Instructions are not followed
      - Output is not in expected format (not sorted, missing fields,
        wrong delimiter, unusual characters in the files, etc.)
      - There are more files in your repository than need to be
      - There are additional lines in the results files (whether empty
        or not)
      - Files in repository are not the requested filename
      - Homework is late

# Policies

## General Course Policies

  - **Attendance:** Given the technical nature of this course, and the
    breadth of topics discussed, you must attend every class session.
    **Attendance will be tracked and is part of your grade.** Please
    contact us in advance if you are not able to attend class. Excused
    absences in advance will not affect your attendance grade.
    **Unexcused absences will be deducted from your attendance grade.**
  - **Participation:** We love participation. Read. Raise your hand. Ask
    questions. Make comments. Challenge us. Acknowledge us. If we speak
    for three hours to a silent classroom, it is a lot more boring and
    tiring for everyone.
  - **Computer Usage:** You must bring your laptop to class to work on
    labs. Please refrain from other activities. **You may not use your
    computer while your peers or guest speakers are presenting.**
  - **E-mail:** We (Irina and Marck) will try to respond to email within
    36 hours. Use email for questions **not** related to homework,
    material or techincal questions. If you do email us, please email
    **both** Irina and Marck.
  - **Online Discussion Boards:** Please use the discussion board on
    Canvas for questions about the course, homework assignments,
    technical issues, etc. TA’s will be monitoring them and providing
    answers. Answering individual questions submitted by email does not
    scale, and the likelihood of many students having the same question
    is high. Using the forums is a great resource for everyone.
  - **Name Tents:** You will be given a name tent **to be used in every
    class** so we get to know you better and quicker. TA’s will keep the
    name tents and will be used to track attendance. Grab your name tent
    on the way in and return it before leaving.
  - **Cloud Resources:** You will create cloud accounts on Amazon Web
    Services and Microsoft Azure. You will get credits on both platforms
    that will be enough to support your coursework throughout the
    semester. **It is your responsibility to manage the credits and
    resources yourself. If you run out of credits because you do not
    shut down your resources, we cannot help you.**
  - **Allocate Time for Assignments:** Homeworks take time, so please do
    not wait until the last minute to start them. Give yourself several
    days to work on problem sets. While the tools have matured a lot
    over the years, there are cases where you will run into unforseen
    technical difficulties. All homework assignments have been
    thoroughly tested using the technical configuration provided in the
    assignment and they work. *“It didn’t work for me”* is not an
    excuse. *“I lost my code because I didn’t push to github”* is not an
    excuse. *“It took me too long because it was the first time I’m
    doing it”* is not an excuse.
  - **Late Policy**: Assigments are due at the end of the day (11:59pm
    Eastern Time) on the due date. Due dates will not be extended, and
    late homeworks will incur a late penalty of 25% per day. However,
    each student has 2 (two) “late” days that can be used throughout the
    semester however they wish on the assignments, **except for the
    individual mini project**, wihtout incurring a late penalty. You can
    submit one assignment two days late, or two assignments one day
    late. After that, the standard 25% deduction will apply.

## Open Door Policy

Please approach or get in touch with us if something is not working for
you regarding the class, methods, etc. Our pledge to you is to provide
the best learning experience possible. If you have any issue please do
not wait until the last minute to speak with us. You will find that we
are fair, reasonable and flexible and we deeply care about your success.

## Academic Integrity

All students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic
and personal integrity in pursuit of their education at Georgetown.
Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, in any form is a serious
offense, and students found in violation are subject to academic
penalties that include, but are not limited to, failure of the course,
termination from the program, and revocation of degrees already
conferred. All students are held to the Georgetown University Honor
Code. For more information about the Honor Code see
<http://gervaseprograms.georgetown.edu/honor/>

You may collaborate with other students during in-class labs to
facilitate collective learning. Regarding assignments, though, only
limited collaboration is allowed.

  - You may discuss ideas on how to solve the problem with other
    students
  - You may work alongside other students
  - You may get help from other students if you are stuck and/or are
    having technical difficulties on steps to take

**BUT**

  - **You may not share code**
  - **All submitted code and scripts written must be your own**
  - **You must do all your work on your own cloud resources**

**We have a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY.**

## Accommodations for students with disabilities

Students with documented disabilities have the right to specific
accommodations that do not fundamentally alter the nature of the course.
Please alert us should you require accommodations.

## Title IX Sexual Misconduct Statement

Please know that as faculty members we are committed to supporting
survivors of sexual misconduct, including relationship violence and
sexual assault. However, university policy also requires us to report
any disclosures about sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator,
whose role is to coordinate the University’s response to sexual
misconduct.

Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources who
can provide support and assistance to survivors of sexual assault and
other forms of sexual misconduct.

More information about campus resources and reporting sexual misconduct
can be found at <http://sexualassault.georgetown.edu>
